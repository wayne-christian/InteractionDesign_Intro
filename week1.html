              <h4>Studying Interaction Design</h4>
              <p>Regardless of how complex or useful a device is, you need to design it in such a way that a user can
        use it to fulfill the functions that it is supposed to fulfill</p>
              <p class="fragment">Studying / designing the interaction between humans and computers has changed as the technology changed</p>
              <p class="fragment">As the tech changes, the philosophy changes (Wearables, IOT,AI, ML, VR,AR)</p>
            </section>
    <section>
              <h4>Man-Machine Interface</h4>
              <p class="fragment tight bullet">As soon as computers became useful, a significant problem arose; very few people were able to use them.</p>
              <p class="fragment tight bullet">Interest was born in the design of the interface between man and machine.</p>
              <p class="fragment tight bullet">Programming languages were the most significant development in this stage.</p>
              <p class="fragment tight bullet">A beginning of how to study that interaction between people &amp; machines</p>

              <p class="fragment tight bullet">NASA and IBM pioneered this work (NASA TLX)</p>
              <p class="fragment tight bullet">A lot of the concepts and methods in HCI are borrowed from engineering</p>
            </section>
    <section>
              <h4>Usability &amp; Accessibility</h4>
              <p class="fragment tight bullet">Era of desk-top computing. Suddenly “usability” becomes a billion dollar industry.</p>
              <p class="fragment tight bullet">The design of interfaces that allow people to do their work without being massively frustrated</p>
              <p class="fragment tight bullet">Based on cognitive psychology. Understanding what people are capable of and comfortable with in terms of perception &amp; memory.</p>

              <h3>1D: Words</h3>
              <p>This dimension defines the interactions. </p>
              <p>Words are the interaction that users use to interact with.</p>

    <section>
              <h3>2D: Visual Representations</h3>
              <p>The visual representations are the things that the user interacts with on the interface. These may include but not limited to “typography, diagrams, icons, and other graphics”</p>
            </section>

    <section>
              <h3>3D: Physical objects or space</h3>
              <p>The space with which the user interacts is the third dimension of interaction design. It defines the space or objects “with which or within which users interact”</p>

    <section>
              <h4>4D: Time</h4>
              <p>The time with which the user interacts with the interface. Some examples of this are “content that changes over time such as sound, video, or animation”</p>

              <h4>5D: Behavior</h4>
              <p>The behaviour defines the users actions in reaction to the interface and how they respond to it.</p>

		<h4>Work Shop (MS Whiteboard test)</h4>
			<p >Next, we will do a series of short (30 mins) brainstorming design tasks. Designed to illustrate the types of activities that an interaction designer may undertake in early stages of design of a product / application / solution (consider the emotional responses)<br /></p>
			<p class="fragment tight bullet">1 The product that you need to design is a mobile phone application that encourages people to eat healthily. The details of how it does this are up to you (ie., this should be the focus of your design work).<br /></p>
