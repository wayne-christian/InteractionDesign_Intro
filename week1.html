              <h4>Studying Interaction Design</h4>
              <p>Regardless of how complex or useful a device is, you
        need to design it in such a way that a user can
        use it to fulfill the functions that it is supposed to fulfill</p>
              <p class="bullet">Studying / designing the interaction between humans and computers has changed as the technology changed</p>
              <p class="bullet">As the tech changes, the philosophy changes</p>
            </section>
    <section>
              <h4>Man-Machine Interface</h4>
              <p class="fragment tight bullet">As soon as computers became useful, a significant problem arose; very few people were able to use them.</p>
              <p class="fragment tight bullet">Interest was born in the design of the interface between man and machine.</p>
              <p class="fragment tight bullet">Programming languages were the most significant development in this stage.</p>
              <p class="fragment tight bullet">A beginning of how to study that interaction between people &amp; machines</p>

              <p class="fragment tight bullet">NASA and IBM pioneered this work</p>

              <h4>Usability &amp; Accessibility</h4>
              <p class="fragment tight bullet">Era of desk-top computing. Suddenly “usability” becomes a billion dollar industry.</p>
              <p class="fragment tight bullet">The design of interfaces that allow people to do their work without being massively frustrated</p>

              <h3>1D: Words</h3>
              <p>This dimension defines the interactions. </p>
              <p>Words are the interaction that users use to interact with.</p>

    <section>
              <h3>2D: Visual Representations</h3>
              <p>The visual representations are the things that the user interacts with on the interface. These may include but not limited to “typography, diagrams, icons, and other graphics”</p>
            </section>

    <section>
              <h3>3D: Physical objects or space</h3>
              <p>The space with which the user interacts is the third dimension of interaction design. It defines the space or objects “with which or within which users interact”</p>

    <section>
              <h4>4D: Time</h4>
              <p>The time with which the user interacts with the interface. Some examples of this are “content that changes over time such as sound, video, or animation”</p>

              <h4>5D: Behavior</h4>
              <p>The behaviour defines the users actions in reaction to the interface and how they respond to it.</p>

		<h4>Work Shop</h4>
			<p >Next, we will do a series of short (30 mins) brainstorming design tasks. Designed to illustrate the types of activities that an interaction designer may undertake in early stages of design of a product / application / solution (consider the emotional responses)<br /></p>
			<p class="fragment tight bullet">1 The product that you need to design is a mobile phone application that encourages people to eat healthily. The details of how it does this are up to you (ie., this should be the focus of your design work).<br /></p>
		<p class="fragment tight bullet">2 The product that you need to design is a physical installation that encourages people to interact with each other. The details of how it does this are up to you (ie., this should be the focus of your design work).</p>
